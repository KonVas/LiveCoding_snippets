* LiveCoding_snippets
Boiler code for creating sound with the [[http://supercollider.github.io][SuperCollider]] language in a
live set-up. The examples are using [[http://doc.sccode.org/Overviews/JITLib.html][JITLib]], a set of tools for building sound modules that allows to be reprogrammed
in real time bypassing standard SC requirements. For a very brief introduction on the SuperCollider
language see [[./SuperCollider_tutorial.org]]. For a thorough overview refer to the help files of
the language. All examples can be used at your own risk. More to
come...
